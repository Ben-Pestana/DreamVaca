<p>There are many places I want to go in the world and believe it or not the places on this list are only half of the places,
but these are my favorite ones of all.  </p>

<p> 1) Dublin, Ireland -- The capital and the largest city of Ireland, Dublin  is on the eastern coast, at the mouth
of the Liffey River.  Dublin expanded greatly in the 1700s and was the 
second largest city in the British Empire for a short time before the Acts of Union in 1800.  It has a 
maritime climate, with cool summers and mild winters.  </p>

<p> 2) London, England -- The capitol and most well known city in England, and probably the most well known in Great Britain, London is a 
huge tourist destination.  Having attractions, people from around the world to see the great city.  Big Ben, a tall clock tower 
that was recently renamed, is very well known and has attracted millions of people.  London Bridge, star of the nursery ryhme, is not
actually what everyone thinks it is.  It does not have towers, but has fallen down multiple times.  The Tower Bridge is what everyone mistakes 
to be the London Bridge, being a drawbridge with two towers.  The Eye of London, shown above, is a ferris wheel that is a 30 minute round trip.
Westminister Abbey is a large church (very large) that you can tours in and is a amazing place to be.  </p>

<p> 3) Paris, France -- Capital of France, Paris is a tourist capital of the world with the Eiffel Tower and the beautiful city it is.
The Eiffel Tower was started in 1888, and began Paris on its path to a modern future.  A famous museum in Paris, the Louvre, is the most 
visited art museum in the world. The two main sports in France are soccer and rugby.

<p> 4) Rome, Italy -- Capital of Italy, Rome has many tourist destinations, including the Coliseum, which was used for gladiator duels,
some of which were gladiator versus gladiator.  Others were gladiator versus beast, usually lions. Another ancient ruin in Rome
is the Forum.  Along with the Coliseum, both ruins show the power of the Roman Empire.  </p>

<p>     5) Athens, Greece -- Capital of Greece, Athens has many ancient ruins from Ancient Greece.  I really want to see what Athens is 
like with all the ruins because I know what all the ruins originally were and it would be great to see the Parthenon, even in its current state,
because just standing where everyone in the past has been would be amazing.  The Acropolis of Athens is where many of the ancient structures lie and 
that would be the best spot to just go and look around all day.  </p>

<p> 6) Giza, Egypt -- Giza is a place I have always wanted to go, just to see all the great structures made by the ancient egyptians.  
The pyramids are my favorite, and going inside one to see the structure and where all the corridors are would be awesome.  I also want to see the 
Sphinx, and I want to ask it a riddle!
